TLS - Transport layer security 
- It is protocol use to encrypt web base communication between client and sever.

TLS fringerpriting :- To gather info about client and server on the web,Such as OS and browser version of client/sever.

TLS handshakes process :- 
1)client sends client hello msg with supported encrypted methods(cipher suits) to server.
2)server compare the client msg with cipher suits list supported by servers itself 
  and sends server hello msg with choosen cipher suits list and public encrypted key (certificate).
3)when client recives the server digital certificate it uses public key from issuing certificate authority to verify 
  the certificate digital signature.( server name should match the server DNS name on certificate and should not expired)
4)after proper verification client sends random premaster secrete with sever public key to the server and 
  then server decrept premaster secrete with privet key and both generate session key using 
  -client random
  -serever random
  -premaster secrete.
5)client sends finished msg with encrypted session key and server responds with encrypted session key finished msg.

TLS fringerpriting can be helpful in Botnet protection by DDos attack by identifiying client hello massege 
with their cipher suits list which will be the same in all the traffic to the server.
