MSS and MTU - MSS is nothing but Maximum segement TCP size which saticefies all the tcp protocol with 3 way hanshaking
              at Transport layer. 
			  MTU stands for maximum transmisson unit at sender or reciver side where they can handle large amount of 
			  data packets (data blocks) at once perticular time.
			  
			  MTU : MTU = MSS + 40 (IP header + TCP header)  at Network layer layer3 in the form datagram.
			  MSS : MSS = MSS = MTU - 40 (IP header + TCP header) at Transport layer  layer4 in the form of segmant 
			  

MSS : Maximum TCP segement size :at transort layer  without TCP header the chunk segment of data is nothing but MSS.




TCP - Transmission control protocol is transport layer protocol.
      connection oriended protocol.
	  each data packet wrapped with TCP header which consist of 10 mandotary fields totaling 20 bytes.
	  and having optional field of 0 to 40 bytes.
	  
	  1)Source port ( 16 bits) : this field identify the port number of senders application programme.
	  
	  2)Destination port ( 16 bits ) : this field identify the port number of recivers application programme.
	  
	  3)Sequence number ( 32 bits ) : this field gives 32 bit random initial squence number which 
	    incremented by number data bytes transfer.
		
	  4)Acknowldge number ( 32 bits ) : this field gives 32 bit expected number of next sequence of tcp data.
	  
	  5)Header length ( 4 bits ) : this field gives size of TCP header length.
	  
	  6)Reserved bits ( 6 bits ) : this are set to 0 for future use.
	  
	  7)Flag bits ( 6 bits ) : 
	    - URG flag : set when the data has high priority than other data. 
		- ACK flag : set when the connection estashbishment and data transfer.
		- PSH flag : tells application to  send this data immediatly. 
		- RST flag : set when connection needs to re-established.
		- SYN flag : is used to set initial sequence number. 
		- FIN flag : tell that end of TCP connection. 
		
	  8)Window size ( 16 bits ) : this parameter tells buffer capacity of recivers side which used to data flow control.
	  
      9)checksum size ( 16 Bits ) : the cylick redundancy check calculated by sender use this field 
	    for error control during transmission.
		
	  10)Urgent pointer ( 16 bits ) : the urgent pointer points to the end of urgent data
									   this field appeares only URG flag is set. 
									   
	  11)Optional data ( 0 to 40 bytes) : this field contains optional peices of information such as max segment size 
										  timestamp , window size extension and padding.
