ADC : Application delivery controller
- Manages the internet traffic to the requested servers.
- Known as for SSL(Security socket layers) termination, helth checks, TCP reuse, compression, content swithing and caching.
- thire duty is load balancing and web accelerator software that enables the uninterupted interaction between the client
  server.
- It provides functional flow and management of data. 

Application Delivery Controller manages the load of all servers incase one sever failed,
its rout the traffic to healty server to avoide downtime of the systeam 
-Application Delivery Controller can be hardware based or can be software defined.

Some of its functions are:
->Application Acceleration
->RAM Caching (storage of static content)
->SSL offloading (decryption of encrypted content)
->Traffic shaping (appropriate distribution)
->Multiplexing
->Compression (compression of media content before transferring to server)
->Content switching
->HTTP Rewrite and Redirection.

Some of the features:
->It works on Layer 2 3, 4, and 7 for balancing the load.
->It can work on both large-scale dedicated areas and microservices bases.
->It offers protection against data loss and blocks malicious attacks effectively.
->It consists of various proxy server connections and DNS applications.
->It integrates and monitors multiple protocols like HTTPS, HTTP, DNS, TCP, and UDP, FTP/S, RADIUS , SIP etc.

GSLB :  Is an advanced type of application delivery controller known as Global Server Load balancing which is DNS base solution 
manages the resources around the multiple-site-data centres. 

GSLB methods are algorithms that the GSLB virtual server uses to select the best-performing GSLB service. 
After the host name in the Web address is resolved, the client sends traffic directly to the resolved service IP address.

GSLB methods : 
1) Round Robin : When the GSLB virtual server configured round robin method it continuesly rotatet the list of services that
                 are bound to it when virtual server recive the request it assigns the conection to the first service then 
				 move to bottom of the list.
				 
2) Less responce time : When the GSLB virtual server configured to this method it select service with lowest responce to the 
                        user which is lowest value = current active connection * avg responce time. 

3) Least connection : In this method select the service having least active connection this is the default method.

4) Least Bandwidth : In this method selects the service that serving the least amount of traffic. 
5) Least packets : In this method selects the service that reciving least amount of packet in last 14 seconds. 
6) Source IP hash : In this method the service is select over the Hash value of client IP4 and IP6 address. to direct the request the 
                    to the perticular network where the rquest is belongs to.

Authentiction types : The user can authenticte by using local user account or by external serves to access services or appliencess.
				     1)LOCAL : user can access by using password which info is stored on servers itself.
					 2)RADIUS : authenticte on external RADIUS server.
					 3)LDAP : authenticte on external LDAP servers. 
					 4)TACACS : authenticte  on Terminal Access Controll Access Controll Systems.
					 5)CERT : authenticate to appliancess by using client certificate without using external authentication 
					          servers.
					 6)SAML : authenticate to server that supports the secutity assertion markup language. 	 
                     7)WEB : authenticte to web server, providing credential that requires to web server in http request
							 analysing the server responce that user is authenticate successful.
					 8)PUSH notification : user do not have to enter the OTP mannully which is recived on thire registered device 
					                       admin can configured the appliancess gateway in such way on user registered device using 
										   Push notification.
					 9) Native OTP : appliancess supports one time password or OTP without having 3rd party server.
					 10)email OTP : authentiction can be done by user registered email id to access the services.
					 11)nfactor authentication : to gain access to services user needs to authenticate by multi proofs 
					                              this enhacess the secutity of application.

http Rewrite and Redirect :

Redirect : This is client side, simply URL we write in browser it will automaticaly updated to new URL.
           1) User request -> server responce with redirect stastus -> user request to new URL -> server responce with URL.
		   2) can redirect to same side or unrelated site.
		   3) Supports following redirects : 301-Permanent, 302-Found, 303-See Other, 307-temporary. 
		   4) can rediret to same site or unrelated site.
		   
Rewrite  : This is server sida, rewrite of the URL before it is fully processed by internet information services.
		   the changes not shown in browser means those are hidden from user.
		   1)User request -> URL rewites the URL makes new requests to updated page 
             ( the process still in IIS internet information services)-> 
		   2)Redirect status not applicable. 
		   3)Genrally rewrite the same URL with relative path, 
		     if the URL rewrite the diffrent site then URL Rewrites funtions as a reverse proxy

Traffic manager routing methods : 
Traffic manager applies the traffic routing method associated to the each DNS query it recives.

 
1) Priority : select Priority routing when you want to have a primary service end point. 
			  You can provide multiple backup end point in case Primary end point not availabale. 
			  
2) Weigheted : select Weigheted routing when you want distribute traffic across set of end point based on their weight.
               set the weight the same to distribute evenly across the all endpoint. 

3) Performance : select the preformance routing when you have the end points in diffrent geographic loction
				 you want end user select closest end point to avoide network latency.
				 
4) Geographic : select geographic method to direct end users to spacific endpoints. Based on theire DNS quereis originated 
                 geographically.  
				 
5) Multivalue : select Multivalue method for traffic manager profiles that can only have IP4/IP6 address as endpoints. 

6) Subnet : select Subnet method to map set of end-user IP address ranges to a specific endpoints.

Load balancing algorithm technique : 

1) round robin : In this technique the client request send to first appliction server and then second and third an so on.
2) weighted round robin : In this method the client request send to appliction server according to there capacity in round robin manner
                          For example the application has 3 server 1st one has doubled capacity than 2nd and 3rd and we have 
                          5 client request then 2 are sends to 1st server then one is to 2nd server and one is 3rd and agian last one is 
                          to 1st server. 
						  
3)Least connection load balancing : the client rquest sends to appliction server which has least active connections. 

4)weighted least connection : the client request sends to appliction server which having least connection with high weighted capacity. 

5)Resource balancing : Resource balancing makes decision on status indicators retrived from load master of backend server.
                       load master checks regular status of backend server and dynamicaly decides the weight to each server. 
					   In this manner load master check regular helth check on real server.

6) SDN adaptive load balancing : this algorithm combines knowledge from layer 2,3,4 and 7 and input from SDN controller to make 
                                 make more optimised traffic distribution. this allows information about server status and appliction 
								 running on them. 

7) Fixed weight load balancing : In this method the admin assign weight to each appliction server relative to thire capacity 
                                  the traffic is distributed to highest weight appliction server first. 

8) Weigheted Responce time : In this algorithm the server recives the next request immediately who has responce time is low.
                              as well as consider the weight of application server ( the capacity of handling request)

9) Source IP hash balancing: In this algorithm sourc IP and destination IP addresess are using hash generated request to allocate 
                             appropriate server to client. 

10) URL hash balancind : This algorithm same as source IP hash, the only diffrence is hash created is based on URL based.
                         this ensure that client request to perticular URL are always sends to same backend server.

High Availability : -A high Availability deployment of appliances can provide the uninterupted operations in transactions. 
                    With one appliances configured as Primary node which accepts connections and manages server. 
					While other one is moniters the primary one known as secondary node if any reason primary gets fails 
					the secondary takes over the task of primary one.
					- The secondary node moniters primary with regular health check whether it is accepting connection or 
					not if primary gets failed then secondary node retries the connection for certain period
					after which determines primary not functioning normally then after secondary takes over 
					called failover.
                    - After failover all client connections gets restablished again to maintain a server.
					  but session management rules are maintain as they were before the failover.
                    -With web server logging persistance enabled no data is lost due to failover.
                    -for log persistance to be enabled, the server configuration must carry entries for both systems 
					 in log.conf file.
                    - to make this setup both the node must be in same subnet.
                    - you can configure fail safe mode when neither mode is primary.
