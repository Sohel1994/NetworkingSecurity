Network Firewall : Firewall is a nothing but virtual wall or security devices which protects our privet network against
                   incoming and outgoing traffic.
				   Firewall could be software or hardware.
				   Software firewall are programms installed on our computer.
				   Hardware firewall established on our gateway devices or on network boundries. 
				   Firewall also helps to access unothorised site to user who is rely in privet network.
				   
Packet filtering firewall : set the rules to allowe incoming traffic into the network depends on IP addresess, IP Protocols and 
Port number.
Proxy Firewall : It pretends as you who communicating with outer network 
                 they hide your identity to outer network 
				 they known as Application level gateway.
				 
Software firewall : Are installed on our computer those are nothing but client sides firewall 
                    they set the rules w.r.t.  IP addresess, IP ports to allowe or block traffic from network or into network.
					
Hardware firewall : Are installed on gateway devices to protect multiple computers from incoming melisisous traffic.

Port security : logical ports IP addresess and physical ports nothing but access ports of devices or server. 

Different types of Firewall : 

1)Proxy server firwall : Proxy server firewall can block websites or specific IP addresess, encrypt data so it can not be read 
                         during transmission and mask or change your IP addresess.

2)Packet filtering : this firewall inspects all the packets transmitted through it.
                     it is stateless inspection.
					 
3)statefull Inspection: also known as Dynamic filtering where firewall examins the key parts of packet instead of the contents
                        of each packet. 
						statefull inspection monitors connection, only incoming packets that match a known active connections
						are allowed.
					
4)Undefined Threat manager (UTM) : combine a Firewall against the malware (the program or file which is harmful to end points)
                                 , content filtre , intrusion detection (suspicious activity alert)
                                 and spam protection.
							  
5)Next Genration Firewall : it inspects the packet all the way down at appliction level . it combines deep packet inspection,
                            content filter, intrusion prevention and statefull inspection.

Why firewall is important?
-At network edge to block and mitigate external threats.
-inside network protect against the internal threats and lateral moments.
-As software components deployed on endpoints and other devices to filter and regulate traffic.

Firewall functions : 
Access control : firewalls can be used to what kind of inbound and outbound traffic is allowed in network.
Threat defense : firewalls can detect and block the threats before they reach the network.
Logging and Auditing : firewalls keeps track or events on a network , which can be used to identitify security issue.
source of threats data : firewall can be use study an evolving threats and define new set of rules or attacking stratergies
                         to the network.

Confidentiality : preventing sensitive information from access by the unothorised parties 
                  firewall defines access rules that allow only authorised parties can access the network resourcess

Integrity : firewalls ensuring that organisational data remains accurate and trustworthy, is nor tampered.
            firewall prevents intigrity by preventing attckes gaining access to valuable data in network.

Availability : ensuring the data is available for authorised parties and who need it. 
               firewall can promote availability by protecting critical resources preventing them by attackers.


=================================================================================================================================================

Components of firewalls :

Routing : firewall contains components that can acts as routers,allowing devices to connect to large network

Data packet filtering :firewall can use as tunnel to filter data packets based on defination files 
                       and IP packets based on source and destination ports, TCP/UDP source and destination ports.
                       DPI(Deep Packet Inspection) examines a larger range of metadata and data connected with each packet the device interfaces.
					   
Malware Prevention : firewal can scan for malware to verify that link , attachments or web pages are sefe to open.

Network Access control : they provide traffic monitering capabilities with traffic rules to recognize whether the IP address
                         has access to the network.
						 
Remote Access : firewall provide vpn tunnel to the Remote users to access the company network.

web filtering : firewall can filters the websites by their domain names.

spam and Phishing : firewall offers spam email filter to block questionable emails.also block phishing emails.

Encryption : advance firewalls can provide encreption to sensitive data over the network.

Firewall as service (FWaas): 
- nerwork perimeter is disaparing in now days user accessing the resources from moblile devices and remote loctions 
  and organisations are moving critical resources to cloud means many assets are outside the organisations direcet control.
-FWaas provides security solution to cloud based assets of organisation which are not belong to physical infrastructure.
-Fwaas provides next genration firewall security solutions to IT assets of organisation whether they are on premisea or in the cloud 
 and no matter how or where they are accesssed from.

==================================================================================================================================================

Firewall Authentiction types :
Authentication means that they are allowed to access the resources they are claiming for.

1)Built in database authentication : 
built in database authentication means user info is available on database like username and password.
but it need to updated time to time according to new users and who left the organisation.

2)LDAP : You can use Lightweight diretory access protocol to query and authenticate against your directory server.
this is scalable method because a directory service is typically always kept uptodate.
we do not need to update the local firewall because it is querying the directory server.

3)Certificate Authentiction : 
firewall can use public sighned certificate or self sighened certificate to authenticate itself.
-if firewall is public facing to outer world it should be set up with publicly recognizable certificate to authenticate itself
to anonymous users. which are issued by someone like verisigne, GoDaddy are known to comman users like mozilla firefox and internet explore.
-However if a firewall is authenticate itself to known users which are in its control it can easily configured with self sighned certificate
self sighned certificate freely issued by vendors of the firewall and because you are in control of the clients you can installed
self sighned certificte on client browsers. the comman use case is here is SSL VPN users, VPN is secure browser base web appliction
which prevent that error massage stating " the security certificate presented by this website is not issued by trusted certificate
authority. 

4)Two factors Authentication : A very comman method is to configure your firewall to require authentication using hardware token 
as well as your personal password. In SSL VPN scenario you would log in ssl portal using your log in password and hardware token which is 
displayed on your device ( mobile authenticater app)

5)single sign on : In this scinario the user authenticate to network only once and then the info is stored in firewall active dirctory
so user no need autheticate to access the network by providing same info to access network with notifiction.

Content filtering or web filtering : 
-conetent filtering process involving block or allow the content such as emails, webpages, files and suspicious items.
-Content filtering works by identifiying contents pattern like object in images or text strings that must be restricted or screenout. 
-Network admin can configure firewall, routers, DNS server and mail servers to filter unwanted or malicious content.

Types of content filtering products :
Web filtering : screening contents of webpages/ websites.
Email filtering : screening of emails for spam and other objectional contents.
executable filtering : screening out exucutable files that installs unwanted or malisious software.
DNS filtering : Blocking content or network access from untrusted DNS resourcess.

Benifits : 
Boosts network bandwidth
improves employee productivity.
minimize the risk of malware attacks.
Protects the organization personal datas spread over the internet.
cuts down the illegal libilities as it prevents the spread or malicious content.

Web filtering types :
Allow list or Block list filter : filters the web pages or web sites.
Keyword and content filter : filetr the webpages or websites that contains spacific keyword or contents that not allowed to access.

customize filters are also there :
client side 
server side 
Enterprizes filtering 
personal filtering 
Malware filtering 

hardware base : configure routers or gateway applaiences to protect network access of unwanted resources.
software base : installing software on the end users to protect against malicious contents.
cloud base filter system : use of cloud base filter system no need install hardaware or software.

IPS and IDS -> 

IPS -> stands for intrusion prevention system which inspect the suspicious packet and discard them to before reching to destination server.
IDS -> stands for intrusion detection system which inspect the packet and gives alert about suspicious packet to the network.

-IPS/IDS uses signature based logic provided by IPS vendors to prevent/detect the malicious packet .
-so for that the IDS/IPS data base updated in timely manner to avoid new threats.
-This can be done not only on packet header inspection but also on deep packet inspection as well at all end points of the network.
 state full insepection as well as url insepection.
 
 IDS/IPS detection methods 
 1) signature based detection : the packet incepection done by signature of known attacks provided by vendors.
 2) Anmoly based detection : the packet filtering is done by predifined rule rather than signture based known attacks.
 3) Stateful protocol analysis : the packet filtering done by profile of accepted defination tcp/UDP connection for data transfer.

==================================================================================================================================================
Malware Protection -> 

-Malware means the "malicious software" malware can come under many computer software forms 
 that can affect your computer and devices.
-some are viruses, worms, trojans and spyware and more.
-In the case of spyware, it transmits personal information, such as credit card numbers.
-even downloads from legitimate sites can sometimes have malware attached.
-Well-designed antivirus protection has several characteristics. 
-It checks any newly downloaded program to ensure that it is malware-free.
-It is regularly updated to recognize the latest threats 
-Robust antivirus software detects and warns against suspicious websites, especially those that may be designed for 
 "phishing" 
 (a technique that tricks users into entering passwords or account numbers)


types of malware attack ->
Viruses : Are attached to the .exe files so will not spread untill the users opens it.
Trojans : Looks like legitimate software it steal your data as well as access to your system.
Ransomeware : It is attack type that can make your system hostages to lock your data or system.
spyware : It is attack type that can secretly looking to your privet data and gain info abour it.
          example : looking into your internet usage.
Worms : The attack replicate themsleve no host required they relay on outdated Oprating system and no anti-viruses installed.
        It can slow down the internet traffic.
