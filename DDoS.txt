DDos : Distributed Denial of services : means the appications or server resources overhamled with malisious traffic. 
       this traffic genrated by attacker by hacking computer or IOT things who are geniune users. known as bots.
       the DDos attacks catogries in two type http attack and syn attack.
       -http attack found in layer 7 appication and layer 6	session layer we can observed that when page loadin taking time.
       with same http request. at serval interval of time.
       -SYN attacks and UDP attak found in Physical layer and Data link layer where user try access network equipments to communicte with
	    server this in mesured in large no of packets per seconds (example hand shake to comunicate with server.)

DDos Matigation Stages : Means the the targeted server protected from Distributed denial of services attack. 
                         Using the specially designed network equipments. a targeted server matigate the incoming threats.
						 
Stages :
1) Detection : the website needs to distiguish an attack from high volume of normal traffic.
               if website launch the new realese with new legimate visitors it needs to avoid them or restrict them to 
			   view the website content.
			   
2) Responce : The DDos protection network responds to incoming identified threats,
              by intelligently droping malisious bot traffic, and absorbing the rest of traffic. 
			  using WAF page rules for layer 7 attcks and another filteration process to handle lower level L3/L4 attack 
			  such as NTP(network time Protocol) attck and memcached attack.  
			  network time protocol attck means the trageted server overwhelm with applified UDP traffic. 
			  
3) Routing : By intelligently routing the traffic an effective Matigation solution that will break the remaining traffic 
             into manageble chunks preventing deniel of service. 

4) Adaption : A good network analyses traffic for Patterns such as reapting offending IP blocks, 
             perticular attack comming from same region and some perticular protocols used immproperly. 
			 by adapting perticular attack pattern the protection service harden itself for future attacks.

Choosing DDos matigation services :

1) Scalability : the service needs to larger than the attack ever happend. in consideration of growing buisness
                  as well as growing size of DDos attaack.

2) Flexibility : It should be flexible during online state of website while admin working on implement new page rules simulteniously.

3) Reliability : It is like seatbelt the matigation service you need only when you need it
                 but when it comes to functionality of website the network engineer should works 24 for hours to make website online
				 and identifining the new attacks.
				 
4)Network size : Having large size of network and extensive data transfer allows the DDos protection service provider 
                 to analyse and respond to attack quickly and efficiently often stopping them before they occar.

DDos Prortection Techniques : 

Reduce attack surface Area : Avoid expose our application or resources to ports, protocols or applications,
                             from where they do not expect any communication.
							 you do this by place them behind load balancer or content distribution network (CDNs)
							 and restrict direct internet access to them.
							 or else can use network firewalls or access control list.

Plan for scale : 2 scale considered in matigate large scale DDos attacks bandwidth capacity and server capacity to absorb or matigate.
                 
				 transite capacity or bandwidth scale : DDos matigation provider need to provide large amount of bandwidth 
				                                        that the service of your network can easily available to end user of any region with normal traffic.
				                                        now a days the appliction deployed on CDNs support and smart DNS resolution services that gives extra 
				                                        layer to network so this also consider to 
				 
				 Server capacity : DDos attacks are volumatric attack that use lot of resources there for you need to scale up
				                   or scale down on your computation resources.
								   you can do  by using the servers can handle large amount of traffic.
								   or can use load balancer which continually monitor traffic and shift the load between resources. 
								   to prevent overload any resources.
								   
know what is normal and abnormal traffic : base line is the traffic should handle normaly to every request by the host without 
                                           affecting availablity called rate limiting 
										   more advanced protection go further handle traffic which legimate by anlysing the 
										   packets individualy. 
										   to do this you need to understand characterstics of good traffic usually recived
										   and be able to compare each packet against this baseline.
										   
Deploy firewalls for sophisticated attack : A good practice to use web application firewalls against http attack such as 
                                           SQl injection attack, cross site scripting due to unique ness of this attack you can 
										   create customized metigation against legimate traffic list 
										   and against the bad IP's where these request came from.

Bot Detection : 

-Is the process wether the traffic is comming to your website comming fron human or automated programms(bots)
-Bot traffic is combination of all the bots browsing your website and mobile apps 
-There is some good bots and some bad bots 
-good bots are such as search engine bots like googlebots use for ranking the website.

why bot detection important? 
-without good bot detection you even know you are under attack or not
-certain bot attacks leads to account take over, price scrapping and web scraping.
-bot detection can reduce IT coast.- bad bots takes up band width so it will increase the bills form your server, API's and CDNs provider.
-Protect user expirence - sudden spike of bot traffic can lead to slow down the website or crash your website.
-stay ahead or your competitors - some competitors rely on bots that scrap your price or content to underbid or rebulish their own.

How to detects bots and bot traffic?
-Abnormal high page views on your website - this bot attacks will try to overwhelm your website whether it's DDos or large no of scrapers.
-Abnormally high bounce rate - every bot has its goal once it achives it's goal or found out can not achive it then it immediatly leave the website 
this will shows high bounce rate.
-Abnormal session duration - session in the range of milliseconds are suspicious, as abnormaly long sessions human does not stays for at least of few miniutes.
-Keep eye on traffic from unkown locations. 
-Junk conversion like user adding items into the cart without buying them.

Comman bot detection techniques, methods and limitations?
CAPTCHAs : bot can detect by reconising of audio or video to access resources.
WAF : Web application firewall can protect server from sql enjection, cross site scripting and session highjacking.
      they are set rules for good traffic and bad traffic
	  WAF rely on IP reputation so when request from IP is bad then they block all the request from that IPs.

MFA : Multifactor authentication  it can prevent your user against the credential stuffing attack.
      But unable to protect server from DDos attacks such like web crawelrs attacks.


Why bot detection is challanging? 
- now a days the bot attacks not only to the website they are attacking all you end points like mobile apps, server, APIs web apps.
-Now a bots can use same technologies as humans. they can use browser extremly same fingerprints to human browser.
-bot can attacks across time and space means they can attack your websites from several countries for several time.
-bot cab switch between IPs they can attack with different IPs by switch one to another.
-Baas Bot as service  this is service which can create bot net attack by malisious operator to website,
 find loop hole in their security app aginst the successful request.
 
Mitigating bots with bot detector?
-If you want to identify bots you want the advanced bot detection solution.
-bot solution relys on data so its not only analyse request at regular interval of time but also 
 analyse request packet at all end point in real time.
-Must uses server side and client side signals to detect bots. server side bots can easily detect.
 but advanced bot having consistant HTTP,TLS and TCP fingerprints. can not be detect easily.
 so we need browser tracking, app tracking and user activity tracking techniques at client side.
-An advanced bot detection are must be allow good bots.
-Advanced bot detection solution must have machine learning ability to stay ahead of the letest bot trend.
-Bot detection solution must have to tackel or stop bot attaks to protect user.


==============================================================================================================================================================================

How does bot can detected?
-Monitor your traffic and data packets at every end points in real time sudden spice in request and longer sessions 
-Implement bot detection and mitigation solution on client side and server side as well.
-Block known bot and their operators.some known IP addresess and Domains.

What are the bot attacks?

Scraping : in scraping bot immediatly extract content and information from web pages.
           while all type of scraping is not malicious like goole bot srcaping is used to rank website.
		   
Brute force attack : To access protected web site bots try to guess the credential with multiple combination.

Dos and DDos attack : Denial of distribution of service multiple bots can send request to server to slow down the services for norma traffic.
                      or denial of service bot sends multiple request in fraction of second for longer time to perticular resource to block from geniune user.
