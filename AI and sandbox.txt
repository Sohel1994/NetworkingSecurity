Artificial iteligence and machine learning in cyber security.

Benifits : -The technology gets better ovet time -> the AI/MI learns a bussiness network's work and recognize the patterns on 
                                                   the network over time 
		   -AI/MI cand handle loats of data -> Next genration firewall scan hundereds of files daily with no degradation of 
											  services to the network.
		   -Faster detection and respone time -> Using AI/MI software in firewall anti-malware on laptop or desktop is more 
												 effective and responsive to threats.
		   
		   

SandBoxing -> Is a security practice in which you use isolated environment for testing.
              In other words you can run code, analyze the code in safe zone without affecting the application, system ot platform.
			  sandboxing is very useful in zero-day attack threats (the attacks which are never seen before).
			  if appliction has melicious code it can be run within the sandbox without impacting any other network components.
